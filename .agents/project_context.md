# Project context

FireProt is an AMD GPU protein structure inference framework. Its architecture separates model-specific adapters from semantic operation contracts and AMD implementations.

## Active work: Rust migration (2026-10-04)

Rebuild the maintained framework in Rust before resuming OpenFold3 optimization.
`docs/rust-migration.md` and `docs/architecture.md` describe current ownership;
the older measurements below are historical context, not current defaults.
Native AtlasFold plus AtlasLM-3B and OpenFold3 execute under Rust supervision.
AtlasFold N1000 exact parity passes. OpenFold3 N1000 with explicit strict deterministic
execution and PYTHONHASHSEED=101 now passes exact native parity; legacy default-mode
comparisons remain unpassed because native repeats vary. See
`docs/openfold3-determinism.md`. Preserve all existing gates.
The shared Python operator API now requires the Rust bridge build described in
`docs/rust-operators.md`. Protenix Mini-default native/FireProt workers are also
connected: N1000 and N1536 pass existing coordinate/summary gates under Rust PCI
monitoring. Preserve the separately recorded nonzero full PAE/PDE differences;
do not claim all confidence arrays are identical. AtlasFold chunked/HIP/fused HIP workers and Rust registry dispatch are connected;
N1000 and N1536 pass exact parity for all three routes. Additional model variants and full framework acceptance remain outstanding.

Rust now owns native build identities, directory inventories, cache locks, artifact
hashes and atomic publication. Declared host ELF tools also have their load-time
dynamic dependencies resolved and hashed in Rust. All four maintained Torch
extension loaders now use Rust build services with recipe 6; `FIREPROT_RUST_BUILD`
is no longer a selector. Model/operator correctness gates remain unchanged.
Standalone C ABI CK attention and hipBLASLt loaders now use Rust direct HIP
builds, sharing process management with Torch. Typed C ABI publication/loading
now complements the existing Python bundle path. All six maintained loaders have
pinned artifact selectors. Maintained Python is under `python/fireprot`, native
sources under `kernels/amd`, with a root import shim and an explicit historical source path map.
Rust now records explicit launch environments, interpreter/worker inputs and
verified physical device mapping. Complete Python package/runtime provenance still needs work; see
`docs/execution-provenance.md`. Independent installation is described below.
Successful runs now retain pinned acceptance receipts. Rust `collect-timings`
rechecks archived files and output content before collecting model, worker-request
or supervisor intervals; it cannot infer complete invocation E2E or cache preparation.
See `docs/run-archives.md`. Rust owns compiler staging,
subprocess environment, cancellable lock waits, timeout and cache publication.
A separate Rust guard stops compiler descendants when the caller exits, including
forced worker termination; see `docs/torch-loaders.md` and `docs/torch-build-process.md`.
Rust publication/acceptance commands and the pinned mask/bias bundle path are
implemented; see `docs/kernel-artifacts.md`. Inference should ultimately accept published artifacts without repeating
compiler discovery; the current worker-driven build path is transitional. See
`docs/kernel-builds.md`; preserve its explicit acceptance limits.

DiamondHill: `pc@10.120.16.9`, workspace `/media/IntelSSD/fireprot`. All eight GCDs
are authorized; verify isolation for each run. Checkpoint locations are recorded
in `docs/diamondhill-checkpoints.md`. The independent Protenix integration HEAD is
`bb3be993b52713795796c72cf0a46ef8a7323442`; retain its separate Git history.

## Historical implemented state

Latest default: CK Tile FP32 attention for exact `[1000,4,1000,32]` QKV with head-last storage on gfx90a. Candidate `af43d8e`, promotion `8fbdddc`. The controlled reverse-order model comparison improves 13.120 to 12.580 seconds (1.043x), attention 6.712 to 6.183 seconds, with unchanged model peak allocation. The native-agreement gate passes over 7,979 atoms (aligned RMSD 9.37e-5 A, confidence delta 3.81e-6). `FIREPROT_DISABLE_CK_ATTENTION=1` returns to direct SDPA; the older long-direct disable also disables CK and restores chunking. The generic CK attention header patch remains a separate unregistered experiment. See `docs/protenix-ck-tile.md`.

The top-level repository now provides a Protenix benchmark harness, same-seed numerical validation, a model-neutral capability registry, process-start BLAS policy, Protenix runtime bootstrap, short-sequence gfx90a FP32 paths, and promoted long-sequence triangle, LayerNorm, and transition paths for the exact 1,000-token Mini bucket. The benchmark harness checks the selected physical GPU before launch and continuously monitors it for other processes. Unsupported signatures and unavailable extension builds fall back to native Protenix.

The packed long-sequence comparison uses FireProt code commit `14eb9f7`; the latest direct attention candidate and promotion use `3df2e91` and `5236d0c`. The independent Protenix integration commit is `77218da6f5ccf8562a76577dd568869785e6b45b`, based on upstream v1.1.0 `d3b4db6a121dd4584edd85e93744239325a2b72e`. Earlier records misreported the full integration SHA suffix. A complete audit of 248 tracked files confirms that local and deployed source trees match; archived labels and the correction are preserved in `provenance/protenix_amd_attention_2ad81b6.json`. The historical short comparison uses FireProt `773999ae404c561309391fa72902641e5be3fb95`; incremental direct CK and channel-first LayerNorm studies use `619db00e21d942f3ff4f3d202b0b02b93bfe5695` and `47850407da303a21ec84a6327300424082ac4875`.

On continuously monitored DiamondHill MI250 gfx90a GCD 6, freshly repeated native and default FireProt Mini/1,000-token/FP32/C4/S1 model medians were 45.350 and 13.501 seconds (`3.359x`); p95 improved by `3.350x`. Pairformer improved by `3.334x`, triangle attention by `4.159x`, and triangle multiplication by `3.195x`. Peak allocated and reserved memory fell by `74.59%` and `67.46%`. Full benchmark-worker wall time improved by `2.261x`; this includes one warmup and three measured calls, not a single cold request. The final default-path comparison over 7,979 atoms passed the locked `1e-3` aligned-RMSD and confidence gates (RMSD `9.46e-5 A`, max confidence delta `7.63e-6`). The performance-only input has no experimental-coordinate mapping.

On continuously monitored DiamondHill MI250 gfx90a GCDs 6 and 7, Mini-default FP32 C4/S1 and C4/S5 warm model medians improved by 1.369x and 1.359x. Both p95 values improved, maximum peak allocated and reserved memory decreased by 10.83% and 10.59%, and same-seed coordinate/confidence checks passed the locked 1e-3 thresholds. These are development results for one 124-token case.

The preceding packed-triangle implementation combines a hipBLAS process policy, direct short-sequence triangle multiplication, ROCm efficient triangle attention, and handwritten HIP kernels. In that historical comparison, memory-efficient SDPA uses outer chunks of 64 and avoids the native full attention matrix; the Protenix seam omits an implicit all-ones mask. Packed triangle multiplication normalizes once, fuses sigmoid projection with channel-first packing, uses a library BMM in each direction, and fuses unpacking with output LayerNorm. Its incremental same-source A/B improved model median from 20.865 to 13.495 seconds (`1.546x`) without increasing whole-model allocated peak memory. The extension also accelerates the measured long 128-wide LayerNorm row counts and the exact long pair transition. For 124 tokens, it provides contiguous 128-wide pair LayerNorm, exact channel-first pair LayerNorm, and the gated transition epilogue. The HIP extension builds lazily into excluded `runtime/torch_extensions` and has native fallback.

The complete observed C4/S1 matrix contains 57 FP32 BLAS signatures and 3,132 calls. Process-wide CK won five isolated signatures, was slower on the dominant 1,588-call signature, and did not support fifteen signatures. A direct CK wrapper supported 29 signatures and won only the eight-call OuterProductMean `124x64 @ 64x32` bucket. Its small isolated advantage did not improve end-to-end medians, so it requires `FIREPROT_ENABLE_CK_OPS=1` and is not promoted. Global CK is rejected for this short bucket. A separate long inventory contains 62 FP32 signatures: CK supported 48, direct CK 31, and dominant projection GEMMs were slower than hipBLAS. After packing, hipBLASLt was only 0.5% faster in a three-sample model comparison and used about 78 MB more allocated memory; the reported primary policy remains hipBLAS. The fused packing kernels are handwritten HIP, not CK library calls.

## Runtime defaults

The archived `.agents/legacy_protenix_infer.sh` uses Mini-ESM, four cycles, one diffusion step, one sample, FP32, seed 101, no MSA/template search, TF32 disabled, and torch LayerNorm before FireProt hooks are installed. `FIREPROT_BACKEND=native` selects upstream torch paths. `FIREPROT_BACKEND=fireprot` installs the registry and runtime hooks. `FIREPROT_BLAS_BACKEND=hipblas` is the fixed policy in the 1,000-token comparison, but only the 124-token all-call matrix establishes it as the best measured process-wide option. `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_TRIANGLE_PACKED=1` returns to the previous chunked gate path. `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_TRIANGLE_GATES=1` disables both long multiplication paths. Other diagnostic switches are `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_TRIANGLE_ATTENTION=1`, `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_LAYERNORM=1`, and `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_TRANSITION=1`. `FIREPROT_DISABLE_CHANNEL_FIRST_LAYERNORM=1` disables the short exact-stride kernel. Direct CK requires `FIREPROT_ENABLE_CK_OPS=1`.

Recycle-cut measurements produced C1/C2/C3/C4 medians of 123.86, 189.20, 259.57, and 334.48 ms. C1/C2/C3 differed from C4 by 5.760, 2.691, and 4.221 Angstrom aligned RMSD. The result is not monotonic on the single development example, so C4 remains the default and lower cycle counts are explicit approximate requests.

## Next measurement

The attention profile and first CK tuning pass are complete. AOTriton `attn_fwd` accounts for about 5.333 seconds of the preceding attention stage. Direct SDPA removes outer chunk assignments and layout copies for the exact implicit-mask bucket: the final model median is 13.124 seconds, attention 6.726 seconds, with unchanged allocated peak. Bidirectional same-source A/B gives 1.026–1.028x incremental model gains. Native agreement passes the unchanged coordinate/confidence gates. `FIREPROT_DISABLE_LONG_DIRECT_ATTENTION=1` restores chunked SDPA.

CK Tile QRKSVS is now compiled, measured, integrated, and promoted for the exact N1000 bucket. Its M128/N64, four-wave configuration measures 32.711 ms including bias packing and output allocation, versus direct SDPA's 36.35–36.36 ms. K16 is required by the installed pipeline's two-stage prefetch constraint at head dimension 32. M32 tiles and fast exp2 were slower; the old generic CK M64/N32 cache-Q probe remains separate. The new loader pins the measured CK version, hashes all CK Tile headers and build inputs, and falls back on unavailable builds. Next extend to multiple real inputs longer than 1,000 residues with explicit workspace and model numerical gates, then revisit dominant projections and triangle multiplication. Base weights and production step counts remain unmeasured. Any recycle-cut policy still needs independent quality validation.

## Latest evidence

- Packed path: `docs/protenix-packed-triangle.md` and `provenance/protenix_amd_long1000_14eb9f7.json`.
- Long BLAS inventory: `provenance/protenix_amd_long1000_blas_a8bbfef.json`; contiguous dimension replay does not preserve real strides.
- Reproducible operator benchmark: `python -m benchmarks.protenix.benchmark_triangle` with explicit GPU 6 or 7.
- Latest attention source, tuning, and model evidence: `docs/protenix-attention-tuning.md` and `provenance/protenix_amd_attention_2ad81b6.json`.
- Latest CK Tile implementation and model results: `docs/protenix-ck-tile.md`.
- Final tests: local 99 passed / 13 skipped; DiamondHill GPU 7 with HIP tests enabled 111 passed / 1 skipped.
- Use `PYTHONPATH=.:Protenix python -m pytest -q tests`; omitting the test directory also collects independent upstream tests. For synchronized remote inference set `FIREPROT_PROTENIX_COMMIT` to the verified integration commit because remote Git metadata remains at upstream.

## Independent installation (2026-10-05)

Rust `install` and `verify-installation` create a Linux prefix independently of the
source/build tree. DiamondHill `/media/IntelSSD/fireprot-install-v1` contains the
validated 57-file installation; its generated profiles point to installed worker,
bridge, HIP probe and compiler guard paths. Five installed model runs pass the
existing AtlasFold/Protenix N1000/N1536 and deterministic OpenFold3 N1000 gates.
See `docs/installation.md` and `provenance/rust_installation_integration.json`.
Do not move a prefix without regenerating its absolute profiles. Environments,
weights, sources, published kernels and writable caches remain external.

## Explicit environment inventories (2026-10-05)

`capture-environment` and execution-profile `environment_inventory` pin declared
Python/import/library trees in Rust. `configs/diamondhill/*-inventoried.json` refer
to immutable snapshots in `runtime/environments` on DiamondHill. Three N1000 runs
pass existing correctness and isolation gates. Coverage is not yet a complete
runtime lock: OS libraries, plugins and external resources still need audit.
Full scans take 17-25 seconds in the recorded captures and are repeated at launch
and acceptance, so default profiles remain unchanged. See
`docs/environment-inventories.md`. Output validation now rechecks cancellation and
timeout before accepting a run; the new cancellation regression failed before the
fix and passes afterward. Final environment acceptance remains outstanding.

## Prediction CIF acceptance (2026-10-05)

Current inference requires prediction bundle schema 2 with explicit sample/CIF
associations; archive replay preserves schema 1 compatibility. Rust parses native
prediction CIFs and compares Protenix structures with the unchanged numerical
gates. Four N1000 requests (AtlasFold, Protenix one/two samples, deterministic
OpenFold3) pass acceptance and archive replay. AtlasFold/OF3 arrays retain exact
native parity; Protenix single-sample passes established gates. AtlasFold CIF
rounding and omitted atom14 slots prevent claiming a complete CIF-to-tensor
mapping. See `docs/cif-validation.md` and `provenance/rust_cif_integration.json`.

## Mini-ESM migration (2026-10-05)

Protenix Mini-ESM FP32 is connected with independently pinned folding, ESM2-3B
and contact-regression weights. N1000 native/FireProt preserve exact input ESM
features against an independent upstream invocation and pass established
coordinate/summary gates. All CLI workers now use fresh per-run working
directories. Mini-ESM recomputes embeddings per request and rejects upstream
truncation above 4094 residues; that bound is not a tested capacity claim.
See `docs/protenix-mini-esm.md`. The maintained shell entry point now uses Rust;
this worker addition does not complete the framework rebuild.


## Rust batch and maintained entry points (2026-10-05)

`infer-batch` executes pinned requests sequentially with a shared cancellation
flag, explicit batch deadline and per-job accepted archives. The three-model
L124 smoke uses a 600-second deadline and retains C4/step1/sample1/FP32/seed101.
Tiny-default native and FireProt pass the existing coordinate/confidence gates
against an independent upstream reference on that development case. No long
Tiny performance claim is established. `scripts/infer.sh REQUEST PROFILE` and
`scripts/smoke.sh [MANIFEST]` now exec Rust; original launchers are archived under
`.agents/legacy_*` with `provenance/entrypoint_path_map.json`. See
`docs/entrypoints.md`. Environment coverage, paired performance verdicts, final
acceptance and remote CI/push remain outstanding.

## Complete inference invocation timing (2026-10-05)

`measure-inference SPECIFICATION DESTINATION` snapshots pinned controls and
measures a child `infer` command from before spawn through observed exit. It
binds successful records to accepted model archives; `collect-timings` accepts
E2E only with corresponding pinned invocation records. Cancellation/deadlines
remain cooperative so the child supervisor can clean up separate worker groups.
Two sequential Protenix Mini-default N1000 FP32/C4/S1/seed101 published-operator
runs on HIP 6 / PCI 8e / SMI 4 collect together and pass existing raw-array/CIF
gates against the native reference. E2E times 42.219/41.491 seconds establish
workflow integration, not a new speedup. See `docs/invocation-timing.md` and
`provenance/rust_invocation_timing_integration.json`. Paired performance verdicts
and complete cross-model E2E acceptance remain unfinished.

## Paired numerical and performance comparison (2026-10-05)

`compare-runs SPECIFICATION` authenticates both collections, rejects changes to
scientific work/software/device/cache conditions, requires exact declarations
of permitted backend/operator changes, and compares every requested sample.
Failed numerical gates produce `performance: null` and a nonzero CLI status.
Three sequential N1000 Mini-default FP32/C4/step1/sample1/seed101 pairs on HIP 6 /
PCI 8e / SMI 4 pass the existing gates. Native/FireProt medians are 50.604/23.460 s
for model time (2.157x) and 87.618/41.309 s for complete invocation time (2.121x).
This uses existing published operators and fresh model processes, not new kernel
optimizations or a warm resident-model measurement. See
`docs/paired-comparisons.md` and `provenance/rust_paired_comparison_integration.json`.
Environment coverage/overhead, AtlasFold CIF mapping, final installation/model
acceptance, CI and push remain outstanding.

## Rust paired execution (2026-10-05)

`benchmark-pairs SPECIFICATION DESTINATION` validates and snapshots every control
before launch, executes explicit pair order through the existing Rust batch
lifecycle, checks every later run against the first baseline anchor, checks each
pair, and retains an aggregate report and hashed order journal. Failure or
cancellation stops later jobs. Two N1000 Mini-default native/FireProt pairs run
entirely through this command on HIP 6 / PCI 8e / SMI 4 and pass all checks.
The 263.419-second batch interval includes comparisons and is not inference E2E;
two pairs correctly produce an insufficient-repeat timing trend. See
`docs/paired-execution.md` and `provenance/rust_paired_execution_integration.json`.
Full Rust tests pass 157; relevant Rust 1.85 tests pass 10. Avoid concurrent
toolchain builds into the same target while identity-pinned CLI tests are active.
